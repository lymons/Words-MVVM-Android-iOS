# Words-MVVM-Android-iOS
An attempt to figure it out MVVM on Android and iOS, with RxJava and ReactiveCocoa

This repository is just a proof of concept about the usage of MVVM to architect Android and iOS applications, and probably contains some issues (leaks?).
The approach to MVVM is heavily inspired by [this post by Colin Eberhardt](http://blog.scottlogic.com/2015/05/15/mvvm-reactive-cocoa-3.html).
